# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of PyBer ride-sharing data by Rural, Urban and Suburban cities and showing the information via multiple-line graph for the total weekly fares for each city type. The differences are evident when viewing the graph.

## Results

### Differences in Fares Among Rural, Urban and Suburban

Viewing the DataFrame allows you to check the fares for each city type and are incremented by a weekly total. This image is useful when you would want to see the actual fare amounts and the exact date they were calculated. If you were to skim the data, it would be evident that Urban city types have the highest fares per week. The same data is also more evident when viewing the multiple-line chart. As you view the peaks and dips from January to the end of April, the lines show different fluctuations for each city type. The same data from the DataFrame is easily read here and one can conclude that Urban city types have the highest fares continually for the first quarter of the year and Rural city types always have the lowest fares per week. 


## Summary

### Recommendations

The data provided can be helpful when considering changes in the future. Urban city types will always have the highest fare totals followed by Suburban city types and the lowest fare totals are for Rural city types. Perhaps if more revenue is the goal for Rural city types, more drivers can be added to the areas and marketing for longer driving distances to the Urban areas will increase fares. The same would apply to Urban city types as well, if more revenue is the goal, more drivers would drive up the weekly fare totals. The fares for all city types were peaked for the last week of February. This data is useful if planning for following years at this same time. Drivers can be informed of the busy times of year and prepare to work more to collect more revenue.
